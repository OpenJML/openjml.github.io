    <h1>About OpenJML</h1>
    <p>
      OpenJML is a suite of tools for editing, parsing, type-checking,
      verifying (static checking), and run-time checking Java programs
      that are annotated with JML statements stating what the program's methods are supposed to do 
      and the invariants the data structures should obey. JML annotations state preconditions, postconditions, invariants and the like about a method or class; 
      OpenJML's tools will then check that the implementation and the specifications are consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a
      behavioral interface specification language (<a href="https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/JML/jmlkluwer/jmlkluwer_1.html">BISL</a>)
      that can be used to specify the behavior of
      <a href="https://java.sun.com/docs/">Java</a> modules.
      It combines the design by contract approach of
      <a href="https://www.eiffel.com/">Eiffel</a> and 
      the model-based specification approach of the
      <a href="https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/larch-faq.html">Larch</a>
      family of interface specification languages,
      with some elements of the
      <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~mjb/refcalc-tut/home.html">
	refinement calculus</a>. 
      There is a web site for JML <a href="https://www.jmlspecs.org">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      OpenJML is a command-line tool that has the following capabilities:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>parsing and type-checking</strong> of Java+JML programs</li>
	<li><strong>static checking</strong> of JML annotations using backend SMT solvers</li>
	<li><strong>runtime-assertion checking</strong>, using an extension of the OpenJDK Java compiler</li>
      </ul>
<!--
      <li>an Eclipse plug-in that </li>
      <ul>
	<li>encapsulates the capabilities of the command-line tool in an Eclipse GUI that provides many UI features appropriate to JML annotations</li>
	<li>permits <strong>interactively exploring counter-examples </strong>resulting from failed attempts to verify assertions</li>
      </ul>
      <li>a programmatic API that gives programmatic access to the command-line tool capabilities from Java programs</li>
-->

    Other features that are in development include
    <ul>
      <li>integration with IDEs like IntelliJ and Eclipse,
      <li>generation of javadoc documentation embellished with JML information,</li>
      <li>generation of annotation templates,</li>
      <li>inference of specifications from implementations,</li>
      <li>and auto-generation of test cases using symbolic execution, guided by JML annotations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    OpenJML is intended to replace the original JML2 tools developed at ISU (which only worked through Java 1.4).

    <h1>People</h1> 
    <p>
      OpenJML is developed by David Cok. It is based on 
      <a href="https://www.jmlspecs.org">JML</a>,
      <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">the OpenJDK compiler</a>, 
      <a href="https://eclipse.org">Eclipse plug-ins</a>, and 
      <a href="https://www.smtlib.org">SMT-lib based SMT solvers</a>,
      all of which have had countless other people contributing to them.
    </p><p>
      The following have also contributed to OpenJML in various ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gary Leavens, for collaboration on JML syntax and semantics, as well as bug reports and sponsoring senior design teams
      <li><a href="https://cs.ucf.edu/~jls">John Singleton</a> (@ UCF with Gary Leavens)
      <li>Dan Zimmerman, Marieke Huisman, Wojciech Mostowski, Arend Rensink and others for usability suggestions and bugs while preparing course materials
      <li>Gunjan Aggarwal (GrammaTech engineer) for reworking the organization of OpenJML testing
      <li>Joshua Robbins (NSF REU intern at GrammaTech) for debugging and testing
      <li>Daniel Houck (Harvey-Mudd undergraduate, under Dan Zimmerman) for the initial implementation of syntax coloring
      <li>John Singleton, through his Ph.D. thesis</li>
      <li>Various senior design teams at UCF
      <li>all those that communicated bug reports and tested fixes
    </ul>
