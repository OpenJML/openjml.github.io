title: JML Tutorial - Managing Proofs
---


By default, OpenJML will attempt to verify every method in every file listed on the command-line. 
That is a lot of proof attempts and will likely take a while; a complete run is appropriate for 
the occasional full-system test, but is inefficient for editing, debugging and retrying proof attempts.

This section describes some techniques for managing proofs. These are specific to the OpenJML tool.
