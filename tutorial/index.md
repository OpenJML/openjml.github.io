title: JML Tutorial

<i>Last Modified: <script type="text/javascript"> document.write(new Date(document.lastModified).toUTCString())</script></i>

These pages provide a quick introduction to JML (the Java Modeling Language) and 
OpenJML (a tool that checks specifications written in JML for Java programs)
in the form of an on-line tutorial.

You should 
* read the brief [What is Deductive Verification](Introduction) page to clearly understand the overall concept of deductive verification
* follow the installation/execution/syntax instructions just enough to get you going
* start with the Simple Method Specification seequence, but
* branch out into other topics as you are interested

```diff
! This tutorial is a Work In Progress (March 2022).
! Expect lots of editing and new pages.
```

The tutorial does not cover all aspects of JML and OpenJML. See also the 
[JML Reference Manual](../documentation/JML_Reference_Manual.pdf)
and the [OpenJML Reference Manual](../documentation/OpenJMLUserGuide.pdf).

Many tutorial pages have links to supplementary exercises. A table of contents for all the exercises is collected [here](./exercises/exercises).

Also note that there are additional standalone examples in a sibling page under [Examples](../examples).

**Tutorial Material** All of the examples in this tutorial are part of the OpenJML installation
zip file, in the top-level `tutorial` folder. For example, the `T_ensures1`
example is present as the `T_ensures1.java` file. From within the tutorial
folder, you can run the example using `../openjml -esc T_ensures1.java`.
Examples that produce output (e.g., error messages) have a corresponding `.out`
file containing the expected output.
The command-line to run the example is shown in the first line of the
example code; just add the appropriate path to the `openjml` command.
