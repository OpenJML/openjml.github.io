      <p>OpenJML is a tool for working with logical annotations in Java programs. It enables static or run-time checking of the validity of the annotations, with other features underway.
      <p>The tool is available as a standalone command-line application
      for MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04), with Windows Cygwin in progress.
      
      
      

      <h2>Installing OpenJML (Command Line Tool)</h2>

      <p>The OpenJML command line tool is OS-dependent. Download the 
      appropriate release from the 
        <a href="https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/releases/latest">github latest release page</a>.

     <p>
     The download retrieves a .zip file. 
     Unzip the file into a new directory of your choice (call it <i>$OJ</i>).
     After unzipping, <i>$OJ</i> should contain the `openjml` executable and other files and folders.
     Some browsers or download utilities will automatically unzip the .zip file
     for you, leaving an unzipped folder in your downloads folder. You can move
     or rename the folder (with all its contents) to a location of your choice.
      </p>
      
      <p>These are the particularly relevant files in the top-level of the installation folder:
      <ul>
      <li> openjml -- the javac-like tool that does (static) deductive verification, 
       compiles a Java program with runtime assertion checks, and other functions.
      <li> openjml-java -- a build of Java (java-21-ga as of 2023) but with JML libraries included, helful for running RAC-compiled Java programs
      <li> jmlruntime.jar -- the JML runtime files needed when executing Java files with runtime checks compiled in
      <li> OpenJMLUserGuide.pdf -- a copy of the reference manual for the OpenJML tool
      <li> JML_Reference_Manual.pdf -- a copy of the JML (language) reference manual
      <li> openjml-compile -- this script compiles a Java program that uses openjml capabilities programmatically
      <li> openjml-run -- this script runs a program compiled by openjml-compile
      </ul>

      <p>Current versions of the pdf file are also available from <a href="../documentation">this web site</a>.</p>
      <p>If <i>$OJ</i> is the installation directory, then you can run openjml 
      using the command line <i>$OJ</i><tt>/openjml</tt>. For example,
      <i>$OJ</i><tt>/openjml --version</tt> will emit the version number of this build.

      <p>Further instructions about running OpenJML can be found 
         <a href=../tutorial/Execution.html>here</a>.</p>
      
      
<h2>SMT solvers</h2>
 
<P>OpenJML uses <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu">SMT solvers</a> as logic checkers. A selection of supported solvers
is bundled with the OpenJML release.

      <h2>Eclipse Plugin (Includes OpenJML)</h2>
      
      <p>The Update site for the Eclipse plug-in that encapsulates the OpenJML tool is <a href="http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite"><strong>http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite</strong></a>.</p>

      <p>Use the "Install New Software" command within the Eclipse IDE to
      add the OpenJML plugin to your Eclipse installation.</p>
