This folder contains all the example snippets in the text of the OpenJML User Guide.
Each example is in its own folder:
- the example source code is typically in Demo.java, but in general, in whatever .java and .jml files are present
- the example can be run by executing the 'run' script
- the expected output is one or more .out files
